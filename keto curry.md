### Equipment
- large stock pot
- any kind of food processor or blender (I prefer immersion blender)

### Steps
1. Generously salt the protein (unless it's tofu)
2. Reduce the chicken stock on high for 20mins
3. Reduce heat to medium and add 1/4 sugar replacement
4. Add the roughly chopped eggplant, cover, and cook for 25mins
#### If you're using a food processor or blender...
5. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked eggplant to the food processor or blender
6. Add the curry paste ingredients, 1 can of crushed tomatoes, and at least 2 cups of reduced stock (do not overfill the food processor--you just want a little liquid in there)
7. Blend just until the eggplant pieces turn into pulp
8. If there is not room for 2 cans of coconut milk, transfer some of the blended mixture back to the stock pot
9. Add 2 cans of coconut milk to the food processor or blender and pulse just until it's mixed in; pour the blended mixture back into the stock pot
#### If you're using an immersion blender
5. Add 1 can of crushed tomatoes to the stock pot (set the other can aside)
6. Add 2 cans of coconut milk and all the curry paste materials
7. Blend until there are no more eggplant chunks but stop short of making it smooth
8. Scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon to make sure you didn't miss anything on the bottom; stir it upward if you did
9. Re-blend if needed but don't lose the pulpy texture
#### then finish up...
10. Add the remaining can of tomatoes and the turnips
11. Reduce the heat to medium-low
12. Cover and cook for 30mins
13. Adjust the taste as needed (+cayenne or +red curry paste for heat, +garlic powder or +hing for earthiness, +amchoor for acidity, +sugar replacement to balance the heat)
14. Adjust the texture as needed (add water or reduce until you can taste it with a fork rather than a spoon)
15. Dice the protein into roughly 1" cubes
16. Increase the heat to medium-high and wait for two minutes
17. Add the protein all at once and stir to distribute it evenly
18. Cook uncovered on medium-high 5-7 mins for fish or 20-25 mins for chicken
19. Sample the protein to make sure that it's done
20. Turn off the heat and let it cool for at least an hour
21. Pack it into 12oz or 16oz deli containers (should make about 15 servings); there should be a very generous amount of curry sauce in each serving--like a midpoint between a soup and a main
### Adjustments / Tips / Notes
- The day after you make it, the level of heat will be half what it was. Make it hotter than you like to avoid disappointment.
- This recipe gives an Indian sort of flavor profile. For a Thai flavor profile, remove half the tomatoes, half the turmeric, the cloves, the amchoor, and the hing. Instead use an additional can of coconut milk, extra ginger, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, fermented shrimp paste, hot thai chilis (or similar), and some lime juice. You can also substitute a green or yellow curry paste.
